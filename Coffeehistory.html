        <h2 class = "caveat_h2">From Cherry to Bean: The Milling Process</h2>
        <p class = "caveat_p"> Once harvested, the coffee cherries go through a meticulous
            milling process to extract the prized beans inside. At OUI, we emphasize
            traditional methods. The cherries are washed and then dried naturally 
            in the sun—a process called the washed method, known for enhancing 
            the clarity and brightness of the coffee’s flavor.
            After drying, the beans are hulled to remove their parchment layer, 
            revealing the raw green coffee beans underneath. These beans are then 
            carefully sorted and graded based on size, density, and quality, ensuring 
            only the finest make it into your cup.

        <h2 class = "caveat_h2">The Art of Roasting</h2>
        <p class = "caveat_p">The next crucial step in the journey is roasting. This is where the magic
        truly happens. We roast our beans in small batches here in France to 
        capture the unique characteristics of each origin. Our roast profiles are 
        designed to bring out the bright acidity of Ethiopian beans, the 
        caramel-like sweetness of Guatemalan coffee, and the smooth, nutty 
        undertones of Colombian beans. Each batch is roasted to perfection, 
        giving you a rich, aromatic experience that’s truly one of a kind.</p>

        <h2 class="caveat_h2">From Our Baristas to Your Cup</h2>
        <p class="caveat_p">Finally, our skilled baristas at OUI transform these roasted beans into 
            the perfect cup of coffee. Whether it’s a velvety espresso, a creamy
            latte, or a classic café au lait, every sip is a celebration of the journey
            from the farm to your cup. We take pride in serving coffee that not only 
            delights your senses but also supports sustainable farming and 
            empowers coffee-growing communities around the world.
            At OUI, we invite you to experience more than just coffee. We invite 
            you to taste tradition, passion, and quality in every sip.
