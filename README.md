Basic Command to use :
git add . // add current file to the stage

git add * // add everything to the stage

git commit -m "This is my change" // commit your changes

git pull // use to update your current version of the code

git push myfile.txt // use when you're ready to finalize the change

git checkout // you use to move between branches

GIT PUSH JUST ONLY WHEN THE WHOLE GRUOP TOGETHER!!!!!!
It is contains Branches for example : homepage about us page..
You should work just your own branch what you choose.
Good Luck!
